## Hubbell: R Package for Biogeographers

This is an R package companion to S. P. Hubbell (2001) "_The Unified
Neutral Theory of Biodiversity and Biogeography_" (Princeton UP). Most
of the coding was made before 2002 in order to make slides for my
lectures on biogeography at the University of Oulu, Finland. Some
random development was made a decade later, and briefly appeared in
https://svn.r-forge.org/. For this release I have adapted the code
for the current **R**.

You can find here:

- Functions to generate random Hubbell and brokenstick communities.
- Functions used in non-linear regression to estimate Hubbell
  parameters from species-area curves.
- Simulation functions for Hubbell dynamics of single local community
  embedded in unspecified metacommunity.
- Simulation model to build dynamics of a metacommunity as a network
  of local communities with independent dynamics and speciation.
